# Audio Assets

This folder contains all audio assets for the game.

## Organization:
- **Music/** - Background music tracks
- **SFX/** - Sound effects
- **Voice/** - Voice acting and dialogue
- **Ambient/** - Ambient sounds and environmental audio

## Audio Guidelines:
- Use .wav files for short sound effects (better quality, faster loading)
- Use .ogg files for longer tracks like background music (better compression)
- Normalize audio levels for consistency
- Keep sound effects brief and impactful
