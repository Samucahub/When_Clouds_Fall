# Scenes

This folder contains all Unity scene files for the game.

## Scene Organization:
- **MainScene.unity** - Main game scene where gameplay takes place
- **MainMenu.unity** - Title screen and main menu
- **GameOverScene.unity** - Game over screen
- **PauseMenu.unity** - In-game pause menu overlay

Each scene should be properly organized with appropriate lighting, camera setup, and scene-specific game objects.
